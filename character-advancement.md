# Character Advancement

As you play, the Game Master will give you Experience Points. You can spend them between game sessions on Developments. See the Developments chapter for more information.

Characters never gain more Life Points. To increase their durability, they must find new ways to protect themselves.

New Crisis Points can be gained by spending Experience Points. Each Crisis Point costs 10 Experience Points.
