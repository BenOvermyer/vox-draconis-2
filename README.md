# Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire

This is the manuscript for Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire.

The game is meant to be a simplified throwback to the tabletop
role-playing games of the 1970s and 1980s, but with concepts and
language updated for the 2020s.

The guiding philosophies behind this game include the following:

* There are no monsters, only perceptions
* People are collections of past experiences and ancestries, and not cookie-cutter clich√©s
* Complex math sucks
* Choices are awesome
* Stories give meaning to rules
* "Nothing happens" feels awful
