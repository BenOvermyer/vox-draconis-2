# About Equipment

This chapter contains information and statistics for all kinds 
of items, weapons, armor, and other useful things. All costs
are listed in drachm, which is the standard coin of Yrda.

# How Much Can I Carry?

Be reasonable about what your character can carry. A real person
couldn't carry twelve different weapons and 300 lbs of miscellaneous
gear in a small backpack.

In general, keep close to the following limits:

- one weapon wielded and one weapon stowed
- a shield OR a second weapon wielded
- fifty pounds of other gear stored in a backpack
- a few ounces of coins and other light items in belt pouches

Anything more than that will require a mount, wagon, or other
additional storage space.

Equipment that you don't have on you will probably be stored
back at an inn, home, camp, or other base of operations.

# What Armor Can I Wear?

You can wear a helmet and body armor. A shield is held in your
off hand, if you choose to use one.

# Equipment Lists

## Body Armor

Body armor protects your torso, and optionally your shoulders,
arms, and legs.

## Helmets

Helmets cover part or all of your head. They come in a variety
of materials and levels of workmanship.

## Shields

Shields come in three types - bucklers, strapped shields, and
tower shields. Bucklers are strapped to your arm and are not
held, freeing up a hand but lacking the defense of a larger
shield. Strapped shields have a handle or strap and are held
in your off hand. Tower shields are heavy and huge, and are
meant as mobile defensive structures. Tower shields only offer
cover and do not grant Armor Points.
