\section{Statistics Advancement}

As you play, the Game Master will give you Experience Points. You
can spend them between game sessions on Developments.

The base amount of XP given for a session is 3. The GM can grant bonus
XP for good role-playing, succeeding at difficult challenges, or other
impressive feats.

\subsection{Developments}

Developments refer to mechanical changes in your character. These can
be things like new skills, improved skills, and so on. The costs are
as follows.

\section{Progression of Your Story}

Players can grant you Player Points that you can use to advance your own
character's story outside of game sessions. Generally, the GM will set the
Player Point cost of a new character trait of this type.
