# Creating a Character

These rules determine how players can create their own characters.

# Attributes

Every character has the following attributes. These define their 
physical, mental, social, and magical capabilities. Each of these 
attributes has a positive or negative score. They range from -3 to +3. 
These scores modify rolls based on those attributes.

There are four categories: Physical, Mental, Social, and Arcane. 
Each category has the following attributes.

**Strength:** Offensive ability or power.

**Endurance:** Defensive ability or resistance.

**Dexterity:** Manipulative ability or agility.

In total, there are twelve attributes. For brevity's sake, sometimes 
you will see references to abbreviations of these attributes. These 
abbreviations will always have the first letter of the category and 
the first letter of the attribute. So, Physical Strength would be 
abbreviated PS, and Arcane Endurance would be abbreviated AE.

## Determine Initial Attributes

At the beginning of character creation, assign the following scores to 
your attributes.

* 2 scores of +2
* 3 scores of +1
* 4 scores of 0
* 2 scores of -1
* 1 score of -2

Note that the best and worst scores (+3 and -3, respectively) are not 
included in character creation. As game events alter characters, 
attributes may increase or decrease. They will never go below -3 or
above +3, however.

# Choose Two Ancestries

Pick two ancestries. This will give you several innate abilities 
and a piece of your character's background. Ancestries are detailed
in the Ancestries chapter.

# Choose a Class

Pick a class. This will determine your path in life and which 
abilities you have refined. Classes are detailed in the Classes
chapter.

# Choose an Attunement

Pick an attunement. This will grant you a supernatural ability 
and an affinity for a supernatural force. Be warned: that 
affinity will be both a boon and a weakness. Attunements are
detailed in the Attunements chapter.

# Derived Statistics

After all the above is accounted for, calculate your derived 
statistics. These are Life Points and Crisis Points. Life Points 
determine how much damage your character can take before falling 
unconscious. Crisis Points determine how many times your character 
can narrowly avoid disaster. They are calculated as follows.

**Life Points:** 10 + Physical Endurance

**Crisis Points:** Mental Endurance + Physical Endurance + Social Endurance + Arcane Endurance

# Starting Equipment

Your character begins play with 50 silver drachms, the coinage of 
the realm. You must spend at least half of it on equipment from the 
Equipment chapter.
