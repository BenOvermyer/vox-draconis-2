\section{About Ancestries}

Your character's ancestry is an important part of their story. It gives
context for where you came from and how you grew up. It also tells you
what you look like. It does \textit{not} tell you what your future will
be. That is up to you.

There are three parts to a character's ancestry in Vox Draconis. The first
is your species. The second is your culture. The third is your biome.

Your species gives you physical traits and some special abilities. Your
culture gives you some ingrained behaviors and outlooks. Your biome gives
you some physical traits and skill proficiencies.

\subsection{Mixing Species}

In Vox Draconis, none of the species are biologically viable with any of
the others. Beings such as half-elves simply can't exist.

\begin{displayquote}
Alex decides that her species will be Human. She then picks Farming Village 
for culture, and Coast for her biome.
