\section{About Ancestries}

These are the ancestries of Vox Draconis. At character creation you will 
pick two of these to represent your character's parentage. You may pick 
the same ancestry twice. Once you have chosen your ancestries, pick one 
Major Aspect and two Minor Aspects from their lists. The Major Aspect 
comes from the general ancestries, and the Minor Aspects come from the 
specific ancestries.\index{aspect}

\begin{displayquote}
Alex decides her character's ancestries will be Coastal Human and Plains 
Human. She chooses the Major Aspect of \textit{Resilient} from the Human
list, and then the Minor Aspects of \textit{Exceptional Swimmer} and 
\textit{Natural Rider} from the Coastal Human and Plains Human lists.
\end{displayquote}

Pairings that are biologically incompatible are assumed to have occurred 
magically or through other supernatural means. Stone-born and mudlings 
cannot make children with other species.
