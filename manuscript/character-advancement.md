# Statistics Advancement

As you play, the Game Master will give you Experience Points. You 
can spend them between game sessions on Developments.

Characters never gain more Life Points. To increase their durability, 
they must find new ways to protect themselves.

New Crisis Points can be gained by spending Experience Points. Each 
Crisis Point costs 10 Experience Points.

## Developments

Developments refer to mechanical changes in your character. These can
be things like new skills, improved skills, and so on. The costs are
as follows.

\renewcommand\tcap{Player character development costs}
Development         Experience Point Cost
------------------- ----------------------
Improved Attribute  30
Improved Skill      10
New Skill (at +1)   5 
New Crisis Point    10

# Progression of Your Story

Players can grant you Player Points that you can use to advance your own 
character's story outside of game sessions. Generally, the GM will set the
Player Point cost of a new character trait of this type.
