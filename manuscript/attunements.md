# About Attunements

The entries below are the attunements of Vox Draconis. You may never have more than one attunement.

An attunement is a supernatural alignment to a particular constellation or heavenly body. It is rare among
mortals, affecting only 1 in 10,000. Those born with an attunement are destined for great and sometimes
terrible things. Some animals also have attunements, though that is even rarer than among sentient beings.
