\section{About Equipment}

This chapter contains information and statistics for all kinds
of items, weapons, armor, and other useful things. All costs
are listed in drachm, which is the standard coin of Yrda.

Items that make use of Resource Dice are denoted with an (R) in their name.

\section{Currency}

The coinage of the realm is the "drachm," a small coin made of silver.
As a single drachm may be worth more than goods of low value, it's a
common practice to split drachms into eight equal pieces. These pieces
are just called "shards." Sometimes people will refer to mixed prices as
(for example) "twelve and two," meaning 12 drachms and 2 shards.

In the following equipment lists, drachms are abbreviated "d" and shards are
abbreviated "s."

\section{How Much Can I Carry?}

Be reasonable about what your character can carry. A real person
couldn't carry twelve different weapons and 300 lbs of miscellaneous
gear in a small backpack.

In general, keep close to the following limits:

\begin{itemize}
  \item one weapon wielded and one weapon stowed
  \item a shield OR a second weapon wielded
  \item fifty pounds of other small gear stored in a backpack
  \item a few ounces of coins and other light items in belt pouches
\end{itemize}

Anything more than that will require a mount, wagon, or other
additional storage space.

Equipment that you don't have on you will probably be stored
back at an inn, home, camp, or other base of operations.

\section{What Armor Can I Wear?}

You can wear a helmet and body armor. A shield is held in your
off hand, if you choose to use one.

\section{Random Equipment Tables}

The following tables are used during character creation. When told
to roll on one of these tables, roll the specified dice once.

\section{Equipment Lists}

The following lists show the details of various kinds of equipment.

\subsection{Body Armor}

Body armor protects your torso, and optionally your shoulders,
arms, and legs.

Plate armor & 4 & 200d \\
\hline
\end{xtabular}
}
\end{center}

\subsection{Helmets}

Helmets cover part or all of your head. They come in a variety
of materials and levels of workmanship.

                       \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{AP}} &

\hline
\end{xtabular}
}
\end{center}

\subsection{Shields}

Shields come in three types - bucklers, strapped shields, and
tower shields. Bucklers are strapped to your arm and are not
held, freeing up a hand but lacking the defense of a larger
shield. Strapped shields have a handle or strap and are held
in your off hand. Tower shields are heavy and huge, and are
meant as mobile defensive structures. Tower shields only offer
cover and do not grant Armor Points. Moving a tower shield to
a new position is a minor action.

most common.

\subsection{Ranged Weapons}

The most common ranged weapon in this era is the short bow. Long bows
are difficult to draw and longtime wielders end up suffering deformities
of the spine. Crossbows are easier to fire, but take longer to set up for
a shot. They are best used in pairs by two people - one to load and set,
the other to fire, trading between the two. Commoners often use slings or
throwing knives.
