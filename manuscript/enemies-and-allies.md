# About Enemies and Allies

These are the non-player characters players might encounter in their adventures. Each is presented with a different set of statistics than player characters. When acting, they use their own abilities as described here rather than the rules for players. Where the rules are unclear for a situation, the Game Master decides how to proceed.

Each being in this section is described with the following format.

**Name:** the name of the being

**Desires:** what drives the being to act

**Fears:** what compels the being to attack or flee

**Description:** a description of what the being looks like, how they move, and how they act

**Abilities:** statistics and rules for each of the being's key abilities
