\section{About Allies and Enemies}

These are the non-player characters and creatures players might encounter in
their adventures. Each is presented with a different set of
statistics than player characters. When acting, they use their
own abilities as described here rather than the rules for players.
Where the rules are unclear for a situation, the Game Master decides
how to proceed.

Each being in this section is described with the following format.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Name:} the name of the being
  \item \textbf{Description:} a description of what the being looks like, how they move, and how they act
  \item \textbf{Abilities:} statistics and rules for each of the being's key abilities
  \item \textbf{Statistics:} the Life Points, Defense, Initiative, Attack Bonus, and Social Bonus for the being
\end{itemize}

\section{Dinosaurs}

These are free-roaming, large reptilian creatures. They
are not generally domesticated and have varying levels
of intelligence. Most are social creatures and operate in
groups.

These creatures generally have two names. The first is
what sages and scholars classify them as. The second is
what everyone else calls them.
