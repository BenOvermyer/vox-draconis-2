# About Classes

The following are the classes of Vox Draconis. They are professions, followings, or 
other life pursuits. Each class will give you some background information, some
unique abilities, and a set of skill proficiencies.

# Dragon-Bonded

If a child is present when a dragon's egg hatches, there is a small chance that the hatchling and the child will
form a supernatural and unbreakable bond. The Illdrazi have built their entire culture around this phenomenon, and co-exist
in peace with dragons.

A dragon-bonded's life is built around that bond, for better or worse. They live with, hunt with, grow old with, and die with
their dragon.

At character creation, choose one of the dragon types from the Creatures, Enemies, and Allies chapter. You gain a dragon bond-mate
of that type. They will listen to you and usually do as asked, but are not mindless servants and have goals of their own. Consider
the personality of your bond-mate.

## Dragon-Bonded Abilities

- **Shared Life:** You are bonded to a single dragon for life. If your bond-mate dies, you must make a Crisis Roll. If you fail and
cannot spend a Crisis Point, you also die. However, you also gain the lifespan of your dragon, and will not die of old age until
they do.
- **Telepathic Link:** You can communicate with your bond-mate in words and images, no matter how much distance is between
you.

## Dragon-Bonded Skill Proficiencies

* Dragonriding +1
* Dragon Medicine +1
* Lance +1

# Raptor-Bonded

The Ardonans are fierce tribal warriors whose lives revolve around fighting. They live in the jungles of Ardona, home to many
equally fierce beasts. Among these are the greater raptors - bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs the size of a horse. When a clutch
of greater raptor eggs hatch, a tribe of Ardonans will sometimes steal the hatchlings and raise them alongside their young.

Often, a raptor hatchling and a child will form a supernatural bond. Once this occurs, the bond lasts until one of them dies.

The raptor-bonded and their bond-mate hunt, fight, and live together. Groups of Ardonan raptor-bonded will hunt as packs and
are deeply loyal to each other.

## Raptor-Bonded Abilities

- **Shared Senses:** If you concentrate, you can share all of the senses of your bond-mate. You can only do this for a few seconds
before needing to break the link, and you can only do it once every hour. The senses of your bond-mate replace your own for the
duration.
- **Empathic Link:** You can communicate with your bond-mate in emotions and images, no matter how much distance is between you.

## Raptor-Bonded Skill Proficiencies

* Raptor-riding +1
* Raptor Medicine +1
* Hunting +1
* Spear +1

# Knight of the Realm

Knights of the Realm are trained warriors who adhere to a strict code of honor. They hail from
many different kingdoms, and owe allegiance to a noble family. When a member of that noble
family calls for their service, they must give it. A Knight of the Realm is almost always
a noble themselves.

Knights are as skilled in etiquette and courtly ways as they are in combat.

## Knight of the Realm Abilities

- **Shield Another:** Once per scene, you may take a blow intended for another. You must be within range to interject yourself.
- **Bond of Honor:** You may make a Bond of Honor with another person by jointly speaking a ritual phrase beginning with "I bind
myself to..." and ending with "...and to this be true." So long as at least one participant is alive, the bond requires both to
adhere to the words of the Bond. Breaking the Bond results in catastrophic bad luck for the one who breaks it. Only one Bond may
be active at a time. If the Bond's wording allows for it to be completed, completion of the Bond ends it without ill effect.

## Knight of the Realm Skill Proficiencies

- Horsemanship +1
- Etiquette +1
- Longsword +1
- Heraldry +1

# Adjudicator

The kingdom of Makhet has a strong tradition of law and order. The Adjudicators are independent interpreters of the
law, and by necessity, they are also highly trained warriors. Their role is to see to it that justice is served and
that lawbreakers do not go unpunished. They are the king's instruments, and have his full authority behind them. As
such, an Adjudicator's word has the force of law.

Some Adjudicators are restricted to a single city, but most travel from town to town. Any citizen can call upon them
to hear a report of law breaking, and once an Adjudicator answers such a call, the matter is fully within their hands
to resolve.

Outside of Makhet, they have no authority, though some of them seem to labor under the illusion that they do.

## Adjudicator Abilities

- **Discern Truth:** An Adjudicator, as part of their final investment of office, undergo a ritual which permanently
allows them to tell when someone is telling the truth or not. They can't tell what the truth _is_, only that the
speaker believes what they're saying.
- **Oath of Makhet:** The investment ritual also bonds the Adjudicator permanently to the monarchy of Makhet. The monarch
possesses a small gem that, if shattered, will kill the Adjudicator instantly.

## Adjudicator Skill Proficiencies

- Detect Forgery +1
- Interrogation +1
- Intimidation +1
- Literacy +1 (choose two languages)
- Persuasion +1
- Shortsword +1

# Fell Knight

The followers of the Fell Titan all come from different backgrounds. They share one thing in common: a desperate
need for power. Each Fell Knight made the pact with the Fell Titan under different circumstances and for different
reasons, but now they all serve the Titan's will.

These deadly warriors are forever changed by the pact. In exchange for their unquestioning service, they are given
frightening powers. The longer a Fell Knight has been in service, the more they physically change. Over time, their
features become more drawn, worn, and emaciated. Eventually, after several years, their flesh - if they have it -
disappears entirely, and they become skeletal horrors. Unlike mere undead, however, they retain their full intellect
and free will, except where such will conflicts with the direction of the Fell Titan.

## Fell Knight Abilities

- **Wasting Immortality:** A Fell Knight cannot die of old age, instead becoming an animated skeleton over time.
- **Drain Life:** The touch of a Fell Knight can drain the life force of any living thing. While this causes no
overt damage, it reduces the lifespan of the creature or plant in question, aging them visibly. This ability can
only be used once per week, as it weakens the Fell Knight's connection to the Titan. The reduction in lifespan is
approximately 20% of their current maximum.
- **Unnatural Strength:** The Fell Knight's strength increases by +1.

## Fell Knight Skill Proficiencies

- Axe +1
- Mace +1
- Intimidation +1
