\section{About Attunements}

The entries below are the attunements of Vox Draconis. You may 
never have more than one attunement.

An attunement is a supernatural alignment to a particular 
constellation or heavenly body. It is rare among mortals, 
affecting only 1 in 10,000. Those born with an attunement 
are destined for great and sometimes terrible things. Some 
animals also have attunements, though that is even rarer than 
among sentient beings.
