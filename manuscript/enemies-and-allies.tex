\section{About Enemies and Allies}

These are the non-player characters players might encounter in
their adventures. Each is presented with a different set of
statistics than player characters. When acting, they use their
own abilities as described here rather than the rules for players.
Where the rules are unclear for a situation, the Game Master decides
how to proceed.

Each being in this section is described with the following format.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Name:} the name of the being
  \item \textbf{Desires:} what drives the being to act
  \item \textbf{Fears:} what compels the being to attack or flee
  \item \textbf{Description:} a description of what the being looks like, how they move, and how they act
  \item \textbf{Abilities:} statistics and rules for each of the being's key abilities
  \item \textbf{Statistics:} the Life Points, Defense, Attack Bonus, and Social Bonus for the being
\end{itemize}
