# Magic

Magic is a force both intrinsically linked to the world and wholly separate from it. It is 
the root of all creation, all destruction, all life, and all death. It is also a force unto 
itself. Some beings exhibit unusual abilities born of it. Others learn how to manipulate its 
links to the world in order to have some small control over it.

Despite its omnipresence, magic does not manifest strongly in this world. There are no 
spell-casters in the traditional sense. In game terms, characters will only ever have 
a handful of pre-defined magical abilities at most.
