\section{About the World of Yrda}

Yrda is a strange and wondrous place. There are lush jungles full
of dangerous beasts and dinosaurs. There are expansive deserts with
ancient ruins and powerful artifacts hidden beneath the dunes. There
are long mountain ranges punctuated by violent, active volcanos.
All of these places are inhabited to one degree or another. Civilizations
of varying degrees of technological progress and wildly different
cultures exist all over Yrda.

Chief among these are the authoritarian Kingdom of Makhet, the
spiritual Inyani, the imperialistic Empire of Gaddar, and the
mysterious Illdrazi. Not all are political, but all are important
in their own right.

All of these lay on the continent of Bardu - the known world at this
time. What lies beyond the vast oceans is unknown.

\section{The Kingdom of Makhet}

Authoritarian kingdom with a heavily oppressed populace. The rule
of law is considered more important than anything else.

\section{The Illdrazi}

A culture built around dragons and the mystical bond between the two.

\section{The Ardonan Reaches}

Steamy jungles, home to tribal cultures that live amongst dinosaurs.

\section{The Fell Titan}

Somewhere between a god and a demon, the Fell Titan is an incorporeal
entity that fights with the other Great Powers for influence over the
mortal world. It is most closely associated with the bridge between life
and death.

\section{The Inyani}

This culture is built around ancester worship, holy gardens, and the
good of the community.

\section{The Wild Tooth Mountains}

A series of treacherous mountains with a handful of passes allowing
travel through them. There is more than one secret place hidden here.
One of those is the Den of Purity, a valley that only Soul Hunters
can find.

\section{The Unknowable Void}

A formless and vast power that can consume even the gods themselves. It
is not sentient, but hungers always.

\section{The Path of Three}

The Light, the Dark, and the Balance form the trinity of this pantheon.
