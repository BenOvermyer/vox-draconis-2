\section{About Classes}

The following are the classes of Vox Draconis. They are professions, 
followings, or other life pursuits. Each class will give you some 
background information, some unique abilities, and a set of skill 
proficiencies.

\section{Dragon-Bonded}

If a child is present when a dragon's egg hatches, there is a small 
chance that the hatchling and the child will form a supernatural and 
unbreakable bond. The Illdrazi have built their entire culture around 
this phenomenon, and co-exist in peace with dragons.

A dragon-bonded's life is built around that bond, for better or worse. 
They live with, hunt with, grow old with, and die with their dragon.

At character creation, choose one of the dragon types from the 
Enemies and Allies chapter. You gain a dragon bond-mate of that 
type. They will listen to you and usually do as asked, but are 
not mindless servants and have goals of their own. Consider the 
personality of your bond-mate.

\subsection{Dragon-Bonded Abilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shared Life:} You are bonded to a single dragon for 
    life. If your bond-mate dies, you must make a Crisis Roll. If you 
    fail and cannot spend a Crisis Point, you also die. However, you 
    also gain the lifespan of your dragon, and will not die of old age until 
    they do.
    \item \textbf{Telepathic Link:} You can communicate with your bond-mate in 
    words and images, no matter how much distance is between you.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dragon-Bonded Skill Proficiencies}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dragonriding +1
    \item Dragon Medicine +1
    \item Lance +1
\end{itemize}

\section{Raptor-Bonded}

The Ardonans are fierce tribal warriors whose lives revolve around 
fighting. They live in the jungles of Ardona, home to many equally 
fierce beasts. Among these are the greater raptors - bipedal carnivorous 
dinosaurs the size of a horse. When a clutch of greater raptor eggs hatch, 
a tribe of Ardonans will sometimes steal the hatchlings and raise them 
alongside their young.

Often, a raptor hatchling and a child will form a supernatural bond. 
Once this occurs, the bond lasts until one of them dies.

The raptor-bonded and their bond-mate hunt, fight, and live together. 
Groups of Ardonan raptor-bonded will hunt as packs and are deeply loyal 
to each other.

\subsection{Raptor-Bonded Abilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shared Senses:} If you concentrate, you can share all 
    of the senses of your bond-mate. You can only do this for a few seconds
    before needing to break the link, and you can only do it once every hour. 
    The senses of your bond-mate replace your own for the duration.
    \item \textbf{Empathic Link:} You can communicate with your bond-mate 
    in emotions and images, no matter how much distance is between you.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Raptor-Bonded Skill Proficiencies}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Raptor-riding +1
    \item Raptor Medicine +1
    \item Hunting +1
    \item Spear +1
\end{itemize}

\section{Knight of the Realm}

Knights of the Realm are trained warriors who adhere to a strict code of 
honor. They hail from many different kingdoms, and owe allegiance to a 
noble family. When a member of that noble family calls for their service, 
they must give it. A Knight of the Realm is almost always a noble themselves.

Knights are as skilled in etiquette and courtly ways as they are in combat.

\subsection{Knight of the Realm Abilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shield Another:} Once per scene, you may take a blow 
    intended for another. You must be within range to interject yourself.
    \item \textbf{Bond of Honor:} You may make a Bond of Honor with another 
    person by jointly speaking a ritual phrase beginning with "I bind myself 
    to..." and ending with "...and to this be true." So long as at least one 
    participant is alive, the bond requires both to adhere to the words of 
    the Bond. Breaking the Bond results in catastrophic bad luck for the 
    one who breaks it. Only one Bond may be active at a time. If the Bond's 
    wording allows for it to be completed, completion of the Bond ends it 
    without ill effect.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Knight of the Realm Skill Proficiencies}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Horsemanship +1
    \item Etiquette +1
    \item Long Sword +1
    \item Heraldry +1
\end{itemize}

\section{Adjudicator}

The kingdom of Makhet has a strong tradition of law and order. The 
Adjudicators are independent interpreters of the law, and by necessity, 
they are also highly trained warriors. Their role is to see to it that 
justice is served and that lawbreakers do not go unpunished. They are 
the king's instruments, and have his full authority behind them. As
such, an Adjudicator's word has the force of law.

Some Adjudicators are restricted to a single city, but most travel from 
town to town. Any citizen can call upon them to hear a report of law 
breaking, and once an Adjudicator answers such a call, the matter is 
fully within their hands to resolve.

Outside of Makhet, they have no authority, though some of them seem to 
labor under the illusion that they do.

\subsection{Adjudicator Abilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discern Truth:} An Adjudicator, as part of their final 
    investment of office, undergo a ritual which permanently allows them 
    to tell when someone is telling the truth or not. They can't tell 
    what the truth \textit{is}, only that the speaker believes what 
    they're saying.
    \item \textbf{Oath of Makhet:} The investment ritual also bonds the 
    Adjudicator permanently to the monarchy of Makhet. The monarch
    possesses a small gem that, if shattered, will kill the Adjudicator 
    instantly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adjudicator Skill Proficiencies}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Detect Forgery +1
    \item Interrogation +1
    \item Intimidation +1
    \item Literacy +1 (choose two languages)
    \item Persuasion +1
    \item Short Sword +1
\end{itemize}

\section{Fell Knight}

The followers of the Fell Titan all come from different backgrounds. 
They share one thing in common: a desperate need for power. Each Fell 
Knight made the pact with the Fell Titan under different circumstances 
and for different reasons, but now they all serve the Titan's will.

These deadly warriors are forever changed by the pact. In exchange for 
their unquestioning service, they are given frightening powers. The longer 
a Fell Knight has been in service, the more they physically change. Over 
time, their features become more drawn, worn, and emaciated. Eventually, 
after several years, their flesh - if they have it - disappears entirely, 
and they become skeletal horrors. Unlike mere undead, however, they retain 
their full intellect and free will, except where such will conflicts with 
the direction of the Fell Titan.

\subsection{Fell Knight Abilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wasting Immortality:} A Fell Knight cannot die of old age, 
    instead becoming an animated skeleton over time.
    \item \textbf{Drain Life:} The touch of a Fell Knight can drain the life 
    force of any living thing. While this causes no overt damage, it reduces 
    the lifespan of the creature or plant in question, aging them visibly. 
    This ability can only be used once per week, as it weakens the Fell 
    Knight's connection to the Titan. The reduction in lifespan is
    approximately 20\% of their current maximum.
    \item \textbf{Unnatural Strength:} The Fell Knight's strength increases by +1.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fell Knight Skill Proficiencies}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Battle Axe +1
    \item Mace +1
    \item Intimidation +1
\end{itemize}

\section{Star Sage}

Star sages are scholars and philosophers with deep knowledge of the heavens.
Some groups of them have built massive observatories hidden in mountains. They
train others to see and interpret the movements of heavenly bodies. Some people
think they are little more than charlatans. Others have seen the strange powers
that such a knowledge has given them.

Star sages often spend time at observatories, studying the heavens. Some of their
number, however, spend just as much time wandering Yrda, applying the skills they
have acquired. They act as fortunetellers, yes, but also as engineers and architects.
Star sages' skill at building marvelous machines is unquestioned.

\subsection{Star Sage Abilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wonderful Toys:} Star sages can build contraptions of gears, belts,
    steam, and other strange and advanced technology. Only the star sage that built
    the device can operate it, as it has quirks that only they know about. The larger
    the device, and the more complex its operation, the longer it takes to build.
    \item \textbf{Read the Stars:} By reading the heavens and consulting their charts,
    star sages can predict the future. This takes at least an hour, and must be done
    at night, with a full view of the stars. These predictions are vague; rather than
    "Brutus will stab you in the back at 3:00 PM this afternoon," a star sage's prediction
    would be "a man you know and trust will bring harm to you today."
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Star Sage Skill Proficiencies}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Engineering +1
    \item Astronomy +1
    \item Astrology +1
    \item Mathematics +1
    \item Literacy (Common) +1
    \item Language (one additional language) +1
    \item Literacy (one additional language) +1
\end{itemize}

\section{Deathstalker}

Yrda is no stranger to battle. Many have died in combat. The Deathstalker
is a warrior who has come to not only accept death in combat as a possibility,
but to embrace it as the one true path. Deathstalkers worship death. The
battlefield is their temple, and violence is their ritual.

Most deathstalkers operate as mercenaries. Their reputation for wholesale
slaughter and religious disregard for mercy and restraint means that they
are both feared and command a high price for their services.

Deathstalkers see it as their holy duty to kill. They restrain themselves
from random murder as a necessary evil; by adhering to mortal laws, they
are able to end more lives over time. However, when law does not restrain
them, they are forces of unmitigated destruction.

Curiously, their affinity for death has also granted them some skill in
delaying it. There have been more than a few practitioners of medicine
who discover that their natural talent for healing came about as a side
effect of their true calling, and have left their old profession to become
a deathstalker.

\subsection{Deathstalker Abilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sense Death:} A Deathstalker can sense death within a 
    mile radius. They know how recently it occurred and how it occurred.
    \item \textbf{Visage of Death:} Deathstalkers have a gaunt appearance.
    Their skin is pale, their eyes are sunken and dark, and they perpetually
    smell faintly of grave dirt.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deathstalker Skill Proficiencies}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Scythe +1
    \item Short Sword +1
    \item Long Sword +1
    \item Intimidation +1
    \item Medicine +1
\end{itemize}

\section{Swashbuckler}

Swashbucklers are flamboyant adventurers with a penchant for the dramatic.
They adhere to a code of honor, protecting the downtrodden and duelling
villainous scoundrels. They show a fondness for ostentatious clothing, and
often come from noble backgrounds.

Despite their apparent bravado, swashbucklers are skilled at swordplay and
display a cunning not limited to battle.

\subsection{Swashbuckler Abilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Undeniable Duel:} The swashbuckler may declare a duel between
    themselves and a villainous character. The target must make a Hard Mental
    Endurance roll; if they fail, they must fight the swashbuckler and only the
    swashbuckler until one of them is rendered unconscious or dead.
    \item \textbf{Daring Acrobatics:} Once per scene, the swashbuckler may
    dramatically change their location through incredible agility without having
    to make a Physical Dexterity roll. This includes things like leaping from a
    rooftop to the ground, cutting the rope holding a chandelier and riding it to
    a second floor, and so on. It must be dramatic and there must be an audience.
\end{itemize}

\section{Spirit Talker}

People of the Inyani tribes have long used the flowering herb \textit{gansha} \index{gansha}
to weaken the wall between the worlds of the living and the dead. Each tribe
has at least one person who acts as a representative to the spirits. These
"Spirit Talkers" have occasionally taught their arts to those outside of the
Inyani.

Outside of the Inyani tribes, spirit talkers take many forms. They are 
particularly valued in the Kingdom of Makhet for discerning the truth 
behind murders.

\subsection{Spirit Talker Abilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spirit Trance:} A spirit talker smokes the herb gansha and
    enters a trance-like state where they can see and talk to the spirits of
    the dead. This trance lasts for about half an hour per puff of gansha. The
    spirits they interact with are either recently dead or are haunting the
    local area.
    \item \textbf{Altered Mind:} Prolonged use of gansha has altered the spirit
    talker's mind permanently. They can sense when spirits are nearby, and are
    able to sense the emotions of those spirits, even when not in a trance.
\end{itemize}
