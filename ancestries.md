# Ancestries

These are the ancestries of Vox Draconis. At character creation you will pick two of these to represent your character's parentage.
You may pick the same ancestry twice. Once you have chosen your ancestries, pick one Major Aspect and two Minor Aspects from their
lists. The Major Aspect comes from the general ancestries, and the Minor Aspects come from the specific ancestries.

> Alex decides her character's ancestries will be Coastal Human and Plains Human. She chooses the Major Aspect of *Resilient* from the Human
list, and then the Minor Aspects of *Exceptional Swimmer* and *Natural Rider* from the Coastal Human and Plains Human lists.

Pairings that are biologically incompatible are assumed to have occurred magically or through other supernatural means.
