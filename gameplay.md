# Gameplay

The flow of gameplay runs in turns. The Game Master will describe a scene, and then players take turns describing what they do. In combat, turns are more structured, and each enemy has a separate turn.

## Turn Order

Outside of combat, turns can occur in whatever order fits the scene. In combat, players act in Initiative order. At the beginning of combat, each player rolls a twenty-sided die, adds their Physical Dexterity, and tells the Game Master the result. The GM rolls Initiative for each NPC involved in combat, too. All characters – whether player or NPC – act in descending order according to their Initiative scores. If two or more characters have the same Initiative score, they are acting simultaneously.

## Actions

In a turn, a character can do one major action and one minor action. Major actions include casting a spell, attacking, setting a trap, or any other action that takes the character's full attention. A minor action includes movement, swapping equipped weapons, or other things that the character can do while doing major actions.

Most of the time, an action requires an "attribute roll." The player rolls a twenty-sided die and adds the relevant attribute score.
There may be other modifiers. The result is compared to a target number that the GM specifies from the following:

Difficulty     Target Number
-------------- --------------
Very Easy      7
Easy           10
Moderate       12
Hard           15
Very Hard      17

Table: Target numbers based on difficulty

## Skills

Many actions in Vox Draconis are covered by simple attribute rolls. However, some actions are covered
by skills instead. If an action falls under the area described by a skill, a character attempting that
action must do a skill roll.

A skill roll is an attribute roll, but may also include a "skill proficiency" modifier. Skill proficiency
is either +1 or +2.

Sometimes, a skill proficiency is required to even attempt a particular action. For example, a character
would need a skill proficiency in metallurgy to produce an alloy.

Skill proficiencies are granted by classes in character creation. They may also be learned through the
course of gameplay. See the Developments chapter for further information.

## Crisis Rolls

If a player ever gets into a situation that would have dire consequences for them, they may make a Crisis Roll to avoid it. They roll a twenty-sided die, and if the roll is over 10, they succeed. If they fail, they must spend a Crisis Point to avoid their fate. If they don't have any Crisis Points to spend, the consequences fall on them.

A Crisis Roll may be used for such things as avoiding death or negating the result of a social engagement.

## The Passage of Time

In combat, a turn lasts roughly 5 seconds of in-game time. Outside of combat, a turn takes as much or as little in-game time as the scene demands.

## Combat

The following rules govern how combat works.

### Attacking and Defending

A character's Defense score is equal to the sum of Armor Points they have.

When a character attacks, they roll a twenty-sided die and add their Physical Dexterity. If the result is higher than the defender's Defense score, the attack hits.

### Damage

A successful hit deals damage equal to the amount specified by the weapon. Melee weapons deal an extra 2 damage if the character's Physical Strength is over 15.

## Death

If a character's Life Points reach zero or less, they fall unconscious. When this happens, 
the character must make a Crisis Roll. If they fail, they must spend a Crisis Point to stay 
alive. If the roll is successful or they spend the Crisis Point, they don't need to continue 
rolling, and the character stabilizes but remains unconscious.

## Social Engagements

A social engagement is a conversation of importance between two or more sides. Before it begins, 
divide the participants into sides. Every participant will argue for their side. Each side 
determines what they're arguing for before the engagement begins.

Much like combat, each participant has a turn. On their turn, they may choose to take one of the 
following actions, or give up their turn for the round. Every social engagement lasts for three 
rounds. At the end of the three rounds, the total points of each side is compared, and the highest 
wins. In the event of a tie, there is no victor, and the engagement is a draw.

No side can go below zero points.

Once the engagement is over, the GM determines the result of the winning argument.

### Persuade

This is an attempt to convince another participant of the correctness of your argument. Roll a 
twenty-sided die and add your Social Strength. The target number is modified by the other
participant's Social Endurance.

### Dissuade

You can try and reduce the points of another participant's side. Roll a twenty-sided die 
and add your Social Dexterity. The target number is modified by the other participant's
Social Dexterity. If you win, the other side loses a point, if possible.

### Riposte

Instead of taking a direct action, you can complicate the result of the entire engagement 
by making a Riposte. Roll a twenty-sided die and add your Social Dexterity. If the result 
is higher than 10, then regardless of the result of the social engagement, there will be 
a complication. The GM chooses the complication.

## Experience Points

This is the reward that allows player characters to grow in ability. The Game Master gives 
out Experience Points at the end of a session based on the players' actions during the 
session. Experience Points can be awarded for any action by the player characters that 
has a noticeable impact on the game world.

## Player Points

While characters can gain in power as a reward for their active participation in the game 
world, players should also gain a reward for improving the game experience for everyone. 
The reward for this is Player Points. Any player at the table, not just the Game Master, 
can give these out. However, only one can be received by each player per session.

Player Points can be spent to alter or enhance the player character's backstory, appearance, 
or other aspects of the character outside of their game mechanics. The Game Master should 
use their discretion in determining the cost of such changes.
